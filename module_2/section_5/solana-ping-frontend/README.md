# SolDev - MODULE 2 Section 4 
## Using custom onchain programs

### All the files explained
WIP

### Issues with this section
1. Why is the challenge requiring use of System.transfer() function to send tokens when this section is about interacting with On-chain programs? Challenge should have something to do with interacting with On-chain programs. IMO this challenge should be assigned after module_2 section_3
2. [Solution link](https://github.com/Unboxed-Software/solana-ping-client) provided leads to code that is covered in the lab and NOT IN THE CHALLENGE. Hence, making this NOT a solution!
