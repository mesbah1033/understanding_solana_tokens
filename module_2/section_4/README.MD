# SolDev - MODULE 1 Section 4 
## Using custom onchain programs





### NOTE TO SELF
1. "When working with non-native programs" what does mean? On-Chain programs vs Reading/Writing to the network directly.
2. What is the lab program truly doing? Is just sending a "transaction" with some "instruction" qualify as an ping/interaction
3. Is there a way to tell an On-Chain program from an user on the blockchain (Solana Explorer)
4. What is a "seed" in the image provided in [soldev](https://www.soldev.app/course/intro-to-custom-on-chain-programs)
